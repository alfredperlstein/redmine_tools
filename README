These are a set of scripts I use for onboarding new hires at Norse.

- onboard:
  onboard.py - script to onboard people, has logic flow for new tickets.
  options.txt - sample options for onboard.py, edit this file to configure.
  redmine_rest.py - module used by onboard.py to talk to redmine via REST.


  to run:
  # edit options.txt to match your environment.
  # edit onboard.py to match your onboarding workflow.
  # then run the script:
  python onboard.py @options.txt
